A very simple compiler that compiles C- language defined in [Compiler Design and Construction](http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/c-Grammar.pdf) to javascript.

#Setup

This project depends on Jison (the javascript version of GNU Bison) which you can install via npm;

```
npm install -g jison
```

[js-beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify) is used to prettfy the code generated by Jison.

```
npm i
```

#Usage 

Use Jison to generate the language parser defined in cc2js.jsion

```
jison cc2js.jsion
```

Use the parser to translate c file to js, for instance:

```
node cc2js.js tests/a.c
```

The translation result will be stored in a file named `out.js`.
